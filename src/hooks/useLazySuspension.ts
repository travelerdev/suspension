/**
 * Allows you to transform a promise-returning function into one which will trigger
 * Suspense and ErrorBoundary components in your React tree.
 *
 * Note, if you would only ever be calling this with the same args, it is best practice
 * to capture those args in a closure by making generator `() => (realTarget(args))` and
 * then calling the trigger with (). This will optimize "needs refresh" check.
 *
 * @param generator The promise-returning function you would like to link to Suspense
 * @param cacheKey A cache key for this suspension. It should be unique to *usage*,
 *   i.e. two different generators should definitely have different keys, but also
 *   the same generator whose access serves a different purpose should *also* have
 *   a different key. E.G. if we had four suspensions:
 *     1. My User Data for navbar
 *     2. My User Data for page contents
 *     3. Friend's User Data for page contents
 *     4. Movie data for page contents
 *   In this case, suspensions 1 and 2 should share a cache key because they are both
 *   the same accessor and also serve to fetch the same data. Suspensions 3 and 4
 *   should have *different* keys from 1, 2, and each other because they are not
 *   fetching the same data.
 * @param options Custom `SuspensionOptions` for this linkage.
 * @returns A two element array. Element one is the result you wanted or undefined
 *   if you haven't yet started the resolution. Element two is the function that will
 *   start the resolution. You pass any args to Element two and it will automatically
 *   cache results and refresh only if the args change. (You can override this default
 *   behavior using `options.shouldRefreshData`.)
 * @throws There are three main ways this hook can throw:
 *   1. Per the Concurrent model, this function will throw a Promise if the resolution is
 *   actively in progress. This is intended and will be caught by a Suspense.
 *   2. If resolution has failed, this function throws a `SuspensionResolutionFailedError`,
 *   which contains the underlying error and a retry function.
 *   3. If you use this hook while not inside of a `SuspensionRig` context, this function
 *   will throw a `SuspensionWithoutContextError` to notify you of that mistake.
